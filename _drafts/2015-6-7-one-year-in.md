I've been thinking about (and working on!) this post for the past few weeks, particularly after I started seeing the (pre-)graduation photos of friends who walked this year. One year ago today I walked across the stage at the Bren Events Center at UC Irvine to recognize having earned a B.A. in Anthropology. As I'm sure people often say, this represented more than "just" earning my degree, though.

- It represented the payoff of spending the better part of *5 years* at a community college not knowing what I really wanted to do with myself before I even got to UC Irvine.
- It represented the about-face of going from being a C and D-student in high school to becoming a student worthy of a few accolades and graduate school.
- It represented the last time I would get recognized for work as an *Anthropologist*, and the beginning of a transition to Computer Science, a field I admit I didn't see myself joining 10 years ago.

In hindsight, the frustrating details surrounding why I couldn't walk for my B.S. (it was nothing I had really done wrong, except be weird and get two degrees at the same time) and other weird dramas seem pretty trivial. It's the people I miss, not the events. Or to be more direct, the events were just excuses to see some of those people one more time. Perhaps one last time, but I won't count out my luck just yet. Weirder things have happened.

The morning after my ceremonies, I packed everything I owned into a rented SUV and drove the ~400 miles north to the Bay Area, where I moved into a sublet on campus at what what would, in a few months, be my university affiliation for the next 5+ years. Within 48 hours I had gone from wearing stoles, cords, and robes to checking in with my future PhD advisor about research projects I could join over the summer as a "temporary casual employee" in the meantime before I officially started as a doctoral student in Computer Science at Stanford. I probably should have taken a break. I should probably find some time to do that still.

As hyperbolic as the word is, "surreal" doesn't even seem adequate in describing this past year. Getting into Stanford's CS program coming out of a stellar undergrad career in CS would be kind of surreal, just because the chances are so slim[1] that *even that* would be incredible. People write about the transition [from math to data science][wat] like that was worthy of [discussion][hn_on_wat].

But that's not what happened; I studied *Anthropology*. My application to Stanford was a complete shot in the dark - something I did because I saw good fit with a few people and figured I'd never get over *not* taking that shot, but certainly not expecting that shot to land. Except it did.

I'm being really careful and deliberate about my wording here because I'm struggling with two seemingly competing biases. The first, perhaps unsurprisingly, is "impostor syndrome". If you've never heard of it, go [read about it][impostorsyndrom]. It's an amazing phenomenon in human psychology that seems to affect everyone, and yet we can't seem to get over it, having realized how ubiquitous this particular misconception is. Fundamentally, it's the notion that you don't belong where you are - that you're an *impostor* among truly deserving folks. One can imagine why impostor syndrome is common - if you place a lot of value and esteem in an institution (academic, industrial, or otherwise), you might struggle to see yourself belonging there.

There are a few things I can offer those with impostor syndrome, but some of the best insights are usually the pithiest. Case in point:

[1]: Not that it's random chance, but the admission rate for the PhD program was [somewhere around 10% in 2011][admission rates]
