I've been thinking about (and working on!) this post for the past few weeks, particularly after I started seeing the graduation photos of friends who will be walking this year. One year ago today I walked across the stage at the Bren Events Center at UC Irvine to recognize the satisfaction of the requirements for a B.A. in Anthropology. It represented a lot more for me than earning a degree in Anthro, though:

- It represented the payoff of spending the better part of 5 years at a community college not knowing what I really wanted to do with myself *before* I even got to UC Irvine.
- It represented the about-face of going from being a C and D-student in high school to becoming an honors student worthy of accolades and (even) graduate school.
- It represented the last time I would get recognized for work as an *Anthropologist*, and the transition to Computer Science.

Unspoken at that event was a lot of drama over why I couldn't walk for my B.S. in Informatics as well (each school has its own ceremony to spare guests a dozen-hour-long marathon of hazardously egregious name-butchering), and myriad other mini-dramas in my life that, in hindsight, seem kind of stupid. I'm not saying I'm immune to them, but I never said I was immune to stupid, so *there*.

The morning after my ceremonies, I packed everything I owned into a rented SUV and drove the ~400 miles north to the Bay Area, where I moved into a sublet on campus at what what would, in a few months, be my university affiliation for the next 5+ years. Within 48 hours I had gone from wearing stoles, cords, and robes to checking in with my future PhD advisor about research projects I could join over the summer as a "temporary casual employee" in the meantime before I officially started as a doctoral student in Computer Science at Stanford.

It's impossible to overstate how surreal this experience has been for me. "Surreal", with its hyperbolic connotation, doesn't even seem sufficient. If I were a truly incredible CS undergrad from a humble public university, it might be a *little* surreal to get to come to Stanford for a PhD. I imagine even for people coming from top tier universities, getting into another top tier university would be akin to a dream come true - certainly it would feel unreal at times.

But none of that's what happened; I studied Anthropology. My application to Stanford was a complete shot in the dark - something I did because I saw good fit with a few people and figured I'd never get over *not* taking that shot, but certainly not expecting that shot to land. But then it did.

I'm being really careful and deliberate about my wording here because I'm struggling with two seemingly competing feelings. The first, perhaps unsurprisingly, is "impostor syndrome". If you've never heard of it, go read about it. It's an amazing phenomenon in human psychology that seems to affect everyone, and yet we can't seem to get over it, having realized how ubiquitous this particular misconception is. Fundamentally, it's the notion that you don't belong where you are - that you're an *impostor* among truly deserving folks. One can imagine why impostor syndrome is common - if you place a lot of value and esteem in an institution (academic, industrial, or otherwise), you might struggle to see yourself belonging there.

There are a few things I can offer those with impostor syndrome, but some of the best insights are usually the pithiest. Case in point:
