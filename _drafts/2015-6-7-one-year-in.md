I've been thinking about (and working on!) this post for the past few weeks, particularly after I started seeing the graduation photos of friends who will be walking this year. One year ago today I walked across the stage at the Bren Events Center at UC Irvine to recognize the satisfaction of the requirements for a B.A. in Anthropology. It represented a lot more for me than earning a degree in Anthro, though:

- It represented the payoff of spending the better part of 5 years at a community college not knowing what I really wanted to do with myself *before* I even got to UC Irvine.
- It represented the about-face of going from being a C and D-student in high school to becoming an honors student worthy of accolades and (even) graduate school.
- It represented the last time I would get recognized for work as an *Anthropologist*, and the transition to Computer Science.

Unspoken at that event was a lot of drama over why I couldn't walk for my B.S. in Informatics as well (each school has its own ceremony to spare guests a dozen-hour-long marathon of hazardously egregious name-butchering), and myriad other mini-dramas in my life that, in hindsight, seem kind of stupid. I'm not saying I'm immune to them, but I never said I was immune to stupid, so *there*.

The morning after my ceremonies, I packed everything I owned into a rental car and drove the ~400 miles north to the Bay Area, where I moved into a sublet on campus at what what would, in a few months, be my affiliation for the next 5 or so years. Within 48 hours I had gone from wearing stoles, cords, and robes to checking in with my PhD advisor about research projects I could join over the summer as a "temporary casual employee" in the meantime before I officially started as a doctoral student in Computer Science at Stanford.

It feels clich√© to describe this experience as anything other than surreal, but I imagine it's "surreal" for students in my cohort (who actually studied Computer Science) to be at Stanford getting their PhDs here in CS. *I studied Anthropology*. In that life I participated in a minga (not the Urban Dictionary minga, which is awful, but the Andean version which was awesome)
