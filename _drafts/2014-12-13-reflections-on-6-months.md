For the past 6 months, I've been working in the HCI lab, a group within the Computer Science department, at Stanford University. This post is, in some sense, a cheap version of an ethnographic account of my experience here - first as a "temporary casual worker", and later as a fully fledged PhD student. Normally I wouldn't suppose anything particularly interesting about my observations, notes, and impressions except for the fact that I came upon this experience from an atypical background. Indeed, the day before I moved to Stanford I walked across the stage at UC Irvine's commencement ceremony to receive a BA in Anthropology.

I also earned a BS in Informatics, with a specialization in HCI, but seeing as I started seriously taking courses for that program in the Winter quarter of my Junior year (all of 2 years ago!) and spent the last 5 years in the social sciences, I still strongly consider myself an Anthropologist. I learned a little Kichwa in Ecuador, excavated at a dig in Belize, and to this day spend more time thinking about Foucault than underscore.js. Still, if you're a cynic looking for a reason to bail and comment that I'm disingenuous to claim I'm not *really* an Anthropologist, there's your ticket :)

I'll skip the boring part of applying to Stanford, visiting, etc. because the only interest one would have in reading that stuff might be to glean some tips on getting in. For myriad reasons, I don't want to contribute to the frenzied topic of grad school admissions, especially admissions regarding top 5 schools.

Instead, I'll start my story a little before moving to Stanford. With my undergraduate career ending and some plans to go on a dig to Ecuador falling through the cracks, I figured it might behoove me to get a head start on HCI research, so I asked my faculty contact (Michael Bernstein) what he suggested. He offered a list of books (totalling some 1000 pages, I can reprint that suggestion if someone asks but essentially it's the reading list for [CS 376][1]), but then he offered me something I didn't expect:

> There is some possibility I might be able to fund an extra student on a project in my group this summer; if you are interested, lemme know.

I had reason to be concerned about burnout, and indeed Michael wanted to make sure I wasn't diving deeper when I needed to come up for air after 2 years at UC Irvine taking as many as 33 units per term, but I took all of 5 seconds to think about it. I agreed with earnest, started looking for a place to rent for the summer, and packed my things. I shook hands with the Dean of Social Sciences on Sunday afternoon and moved everything I had to Stanford the next morning.

At my visit (I lied about not talking about this) I met potential students in my cohort and I started to develop a preconception of what the lab would look like: more than a little nerdy, socially awkward, with a few pockets of those annoyingly well-adjusted people who seem to be good at everything.
