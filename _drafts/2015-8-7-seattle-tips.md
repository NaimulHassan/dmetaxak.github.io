title: Seattle Tips, and Maybe some tips about Microsoft

I've been interning at Microsoft for just shy of 2 months now and I figure this is as good a time as any to reflect on some of the tips I've noted while I've been here. I'm going to try and focus the tips on things you might benefit from knowing if you're interning at any company in the Seattle area (also, pro tip: it's called the "Puget Sound"), but naturally some of the guidance will be more Microsoft-specific. I'll try and separate them accordingly.

# General advice

## Where to live
If you're reasonably social, do yourself a favor and live in Seattle. That is, don't take corporate housing (something Microsoft offers, which may be tempting). Yes, you'll save some money - a nearly infinitesimal amount - but it's just not worth it. In my case (with bumbling and everything else factored in), I spent about $200 more for housing in Seattle (Capitol Hill, in a pretty good location) than I would've had deducted if I went with corporate housing. If you're at a tech internship, you're making enough that $200 shouldn't bother you.

If you need me to rationalize living in a reasonable place, here it is: living in Seattle for the summer (versus Kirkland or Redmond) is worth a great deal more than $200. Being able to go to a nearby coffee shop after work, hit up a bar without worrying about who'll drive you back across the bridge, and be within walking distance of community events (like the [Capitol Hill Block Party][chbp]) makes living *somewhere* in Seattle preferable without qualification (except for the following one).

I'll caveat by saying that plenty of friends (especially friends with families) seem *very* happy with the arranged housing they took, but if you're single, planning on spending time in Seattle, and might occasionally be a tiny bit lazy about going out, just eliminate that barrier and live in the city.

## Okay but *where* in Seattle?
Various neighborhoods have their own distinct cultures, but  Capitol Hill got favorable mentions by everyone I've talked to who's lived in Seattle, with Queen Anne in a close second. I'd argue this was justified, but I live in Capitol Hill so it's clear that I'm biased. I can at least say that I'm satisfied living here. If you're looking for a quieter place, Queen Anne might serve you better than Capitol Hill, but I haven't felt like things were that raucous and I was here through the [Seafair][] and the [Capitol Hill Block Party][chbp].

Central is reportedly a little dicier, the University District is fine but across the bridge making it that much more trouble to get into Seattle (and in my case I'm optimizing for laziness), and the Downtown area around Pike Place and the Space Needle was grotesquely expensive. Not worth it unless... I dunno. Let's just say it's not worth it and be done with that thought.

I wouldn't bother living north of the [Montlake Cut][the cut] (meaning I'm ruling out Fremont, Ballard, and the U District), since that'll give you all the disadvantages of living far from work with all the disadvantages of being too far from Seattle (again, we're optimizing for laziness here). I also wouldn't necessarily live in Magnolia, despite it being in the same land mass and adjacent to Queen Anne, because it's not as well-serviced by public transportation and might add disproportionately more to your commute time than you would otherwise think.

Let's pretend there's a paragraph here where I implore you to use common sense and skepticism to avoid getting scammed by someone on Craigslist.

## Any good work places?
A few really excellent coffee shops seem to lend themselves to working on personal stuff if you're looking for a place to hang out after work. These suggestions have solid WiFi and are located in Capitol Hill, although I honestly don't know of any good places outside of Capitol Hill (and not for lack of trying; one place in the University District might work in a pinch but I would travel *out* of the U District to come to these places, if I didn't already live here).

- [Bauhaus Books and Coffee][bauhaus] is open till midnight most nights (and 1am others, but those nights you should really be hanging out with friends) and has a very library-ish feel with books stacked up to the ceiling. This became such a haunt for me that the people at the register started giving me preferential treatment (moving the smaller pastries aside to grab the biggest one when I ordered one). There's a nice outdoor balcony but with traffic going by it gets a little too noisy and distracting for working alone (it's great for a hangout/chat though).

- [Roy Street Coffee and Tea][roy] is a [Steal Starbucks][stealth] location. Nice couches, excellent WiFi (provided by Google), and pretty good atmosphere. Open till 10:30 or 11pm. There's way more seating here than at Bauhaus and it just feels more social. Communal tables make it easy to sit, work for a while, and then strike up a conversation with someone working near you. Or, you know, continue working and not be annoying. *Whatever you want.*

- [Cafe Solstice][solstice] is another place open till midnight like Bauhaus, but with a more industrial look and feel to it. There's a cool loft setup that gives you a nice view of the main floor if you work from up there. At all coffee shops you should buy food and/or drink in exchange for the space & WiFi you use, but here in particular I've seen the proprietor give someone some heat for squatting on the second floor without buying anything. It's a shitty thing to do in the first place (it's widely agreed that [you should buy *something*][don't be a jerk]), but here I think you're more likely to get shamed for it.

So, you know, be a good patron and buy something easy to make.

# Microsoft Stuff
The following is advice that I suspect is only useful for MS interns (and even then, maybe only MSR folks), but hopefully I'm wrong.

## How to commute to work
Getting to and from work can have a dramatic effect on your quality of life. If it's stressful and time-consuming to get to and from work, that's going to cap your day at both ends with a miserable experience, which will just weigh down good days and make bad days worse. So try to assess yourself and figure out what you want; plan significantly around your wants. In *general*, plan around the things that matter to you and will affect you significantly. Just like the bed you sleep in 8 hours a night is important, so too is the method you use to get to work.

### Is a car worth it?
Simple question, more or less simple answer: It's (probably) worth it if you live in Redmond or Kirkland because you can drive across the bridge (you know, to get to Seattle) whenever you want. I'm not even 100% sure that this is a sufficient cause, however, for 3 reasons:

- you're exceedingly likely to know someone who opted for a car, and if you two are going to the same place you'll carpool anyway
- you'll have an ORCA card that gives you unlimited free use of the public transit system (so, you know, use it)
- you can always call an Uber or Lyft if you really need a ride somewhere

Now, if you're living in Seattle, I have no idea where one would even confidently park a car what with parking regulations and whatnot. More importantly, you're in an even better position to take advantage of the bus system and ubiquitous ride-sharing services living in Seattle. So no, don't get a car if you're living in Seattle.

Oh hey look at that, that's way more than $200 saved.

### Connectors
Microsoft has these Connector shuttles. They're *fine*, but that's it. There's free WiFi, but I've found that you can reliably expect to get Internet speeds on par with in-flight WiFi on a trans-oceanic flight. Except on this shuttle you can just use your phone's cellular service, which is faster and doesn't inexplicably cause substantial battery use.

There's a reservation system that allows you to guarantee yourself a seat, but it's probably worse than useless: in the dozen or so times that I've looked, I've never seen an open spot on the buses I wished to use. This flies in the face of all the conversations I've had with Full Time Employees (FTEs) who claim that they don't use the registration system. So I've figured that I'll go and try to get on anyway, and about 95% of the time I successfully do. The other 5% of the time I get thrown 

### Public buses

## Prime card uses

## Food


## "Insider" stuff
