title: Seattle Tips, and Maybe some tips about Microsoft

I've been interning at Microsoft for just shy of 2 months now and I figure this is as good a time as any to reflect on some of the tips I've accumulated while I've been here. I'm going to try and focus the tips on things you might benefit from knowing if you're interning at any company in the Seattle area (also, top tip: it's called the "Puget Sound"), but naturally some of the guidance will be more Microsoft-specific. I'll try and separate them accordingly.

# General advice

## Where to live
## Good work places?
A few really excellent coffee shops seem to lend themselves to working on personal stuff if you're looking for a place to hang out after work. These 3 suggestions have solid WiFi and are located in Capitol Hill, although I honestly don't know of any good places outside of Capitol Hill (and not for lack of trying; one place in the University District might work in a pinch but I would travel *out* of the U District to come to these places, if I didn't already live in Capitol Hill).

- [Bauhaus Books and Coffee][bauhaus] is open till midnight most nights (and 1am others, but those nights you should really be hanging out with friends) and has a very library-ish feel with a wall stacked to the ceiling with books. This became such a haunt for me that the people at the register started giving me preferential treatment (moving the smaller pastries aside to grab the biggest one when I ordered one). There's a nice outdoor balcony but with traffic going by it became a bit noisy and distracting (the balcony is top notch for a hangout, maybe not as ideal for working).

- [Roy Street Coffee and Tea][roy] is a [Steal Starbucks][stealth] location. Nice couches, excellent WiFi (provided by Google), and pretty good atmosphere. Open till 10:30 or 11pm each day. There's way more seating here than at Bauhaus and it just feels more social. Communal tables make it easy to sit, work for a while, and then strike up a conversation with someone working near you. Or, you know, continue working and not be annoying.

- [Cafe Solstice][solstice] is another place open till midnight like Bauhaus, but with a more industrial atmosphere. There's a cool loft setup that gives you a nice view of the main floor if you work from up there. At all coffee shops you should buy food and/or drink in exchange for the space/WiFi you use, but here in particular I've seen the proprietor give someone a little heat for squatting on the second floor without buying anything. It's a shitty thing to do in the first place (it's widely agreed that [you should buy *something*][don't be a jerk]), but here I think you're more likely to get shamed for it.


# Microsoft Stuff
The following is advice that I suspect is only useful for MS interns (and even then, maybe only MSR folks), but hopefully I'm wrong.
