In the 1700s a man named Wolfgang von Kempelen invented a machine seemingly capable of beating any human at chess. If your memory is *really* good, you might know offhand that it took IBM until 1996 to recreate that accomplishment with something called "Deep Blue". Obviously Kempelen didn't construct a computer the way IBM did; instead, Kempelen constructed a box which gave the illusion of calculating potential moves, but in reality housed a person. So effective was this illusion that Kempelen traveled the world demonstrating the Automaton Chess-player to the likes of Benjamin Franklin and Napoleon Bonaparte. You may know this machine simply as "The Turk" - a reference to the false humanoid automaton which seemingly made each move.

As far as we can tell, the real person who resided in the box was an excellent chess player, knew at least three languages, and ... that's about it. We know virtually nothing about the human who actually made the machine move, communicate, and (reportedly) trounce Napoleon. Thrice.

Roughly 10 years ago, Amazon publicly launched a platform called "Mechanical Turk". Its users call it "AMT". That platform, a labor market of sorts, turned the idea of jobs and careers on its head by offering workers money for completing *individual tasks* rather than *hours of work*. Instead of a single worker doing data entry involving hundreds of receipts, hundreds of workers would each transcribe a single receipt. Or better yet, *thousands* of workers would transcribe just a few lines from receipts.

The experience is such that you might almost think you're dealing with an utterly powerful supercomputer, but in reality you're working opposite hundreds of thousands of "Turkers" scrambling to claim and complete tasks as they arrive.

By parallelizing human tasks and selling access to this pool of workers as some sort of computational human intelligence, Amazon recreated the magic of "The Turk" in modern times, a feat even now I admit is amazing. By obfuscating the human in the black box, Amazon even recreated the relationship between the system's maker and the system's worker. This feat I find less inspiring.

In the 10 years since AMT launched to the public, our notions of the labor economy and of work itself have changed so dramatically that violent cultural clashes have ensued. But the riots were not over AMT, nor did "microwork" show up on any signs; the riots were over conflicts between conventional cab drivers and ride-sharing drivers who have turned that market into their primary source of income, competing directly with taxicabs on fundamentally different terms.

For their parts, drivers in these new markets like Uber and Lyft are responding naturally to market pressures; many of the drivers with whom I've spoken in my fieldwork have been quick to point out that they used to drive for yellow cab companies, but that the requirements were onerous and they found it unappealing. But for all the freedoms thi------------------

The argument almost unstated here is that there's a connection between the kind of information work that Turkers do on AMT and the kind of work done for Uber, Lyft, TaskRabbit, and others. The underlying connection I'm using is the focus on each task - each "gig" - as a work unit rather than hours. Rather than being a taxicab driver, you own a car and you happen to pick people up for rides when you're in town. Which you are, for 12 hours a day.

What we now know as the Gig Economy (or, more formally, "collaborative consumption"), erupted before our eyes in just a handful of years. Ride-sharing cabs can be found in virtually every major city, 

In roughly 10 years since Amazon debuted Mechanical Turk - a labor market of small, discrete tasks contrasting the familiar paradigm of ongoing jobs and careers - to the public, several sectors of the labor market endured upheaval unlike any they had ever seen.
