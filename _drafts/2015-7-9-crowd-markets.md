I've been meaning to write this post for a while, but the impetus to prepare a presentation on my work thus far (and expected work over the next ~2 months) certainly helped push me into a place where I felt comfortable talking about where I'm coming from, what I'm doing this week/next, and where I see this stuff in 10 years.

Yep, it'll be one of those *ambitious* posts.

Technology has had an incredible impact on both new markets and existing markets. To illustrate this, I ask you to think to Airbnb, Uber, and Mechanical Turk. Had you imagined, 10 years ago, that you'd be willing to live in some stranger's home, riding in some stranger's car, or transcribing audio snippets a minute at a time for a few cents (or perhaps soliciting that service)? My hunch is no. These businesses didn't exist until recently, and it's shocking how quickly they're affecting the ways we live and work. Researchers have thought about "[The Future of Crowd Work][kitturetal]" and concluded that "the potential of crowd work-based education is enormous and multi-faceted, benefiting all parties by producing more skilled and employable workers".

That future hasn't been borne out universally. Using Uber as a case study (the argument has been made that "[Uber IS the sharing economy][pando]"), markets like these have engaged in shady 

Last summer I got to work on [Dynamo][dynamo], a platform for crowd workers (specifically Turkers, from [Amazon Mechanical Turk][amt]) to organize and act collectively. This area prompted me to think quite a bit about the areas of research that I could get into that involve labor and technology, and I've been thinking here and there about this area ever since.
