Over the past few weeks something of an outrage has swept across UC campuses over the tuition hikes debated and now [passed by the UC regents][1]. The terms are as follows:

- tuition will raise by 5 percent per year
- this will continue for 5 years
- the state can reduce or eliminate the increase if it allocates additional funding itself
- the UC system will also enroll 7,000 more students (5,000 of whom will be in-state students; the rest "nonresident" students who pay significantly more in tuition fees)

You might quibble over the brass tacks; a 5% tuition increase **right now** would represent a "paltry" $612. Take out more loans, or better yet let grants, scholarships, and other financial aid sources cover it. I reject these arguments on principle. Fundamentally, the University of California is disincentivizing and ultimately limiting access to higher education.

I hate to compare, but I'd have to say that what's even *more* troubling is the collective political jockeying we're all stuck watching. The UC regents have made it clear that this is just a grab for more money and that they'll loosen their grip on students - the only ones whose necks are on the line in all this - if the state increases funding. This would all be at least *questionable*, if not morally ambiguous, if not for the fact that [the regents have approved sweeping, significant raises][2] for administrators such as UC Irvine's chancellor Howard Gillman.

When I was a student at UC Irvine, the cost of tuition was (bluntly) a decision-making factor in my decision whether to add a second major - adding a year or more to my academic plan - or to finish sooner with "just" my degree in Anthropology (which, for what it's worth, I would have earned with highest latin honors). Ultimately, I made the decision to stay in school another year - but not longer - and I managed to pull off the second major in Informatics. It was grueling, and it involved taking close to 100 units a year, but I was grateful just for the opportunity that I knew I would never get outside of college. I made this decision predominantly on the cost of staying in school another year, a factor the UC is now modifying.

You might argue that my academic path has been non-standard, or even suboptimal. I wouldn't, but I could see how you would make the mistake. I nearly flunked out of high school; I muddled through community college courses ranging from Anthropology to Philosophy not just for 2 years but for nearly 5 years; I changed majors at least 3 times, and that was before transferring to UC Irvine where I *added* a second major, representing another "change of plans". Bureaucratic institutions hate those - changes of plans.

Nevertheless, for all the turbulance, weaving, and aimlessness my path seemed to characterize, I ended up here. And so it's here, as a PhD student at one of the most prestigious and competitive academic programs in the world, that I watch as the institution which kindly humored my idiosyncratic and meandering journey uses its strangelhold on its own constituents - my former peers - in a coercive and perhaps desperate grab for something resembling adequate 

President Napolitano has pointed out that these are not just competitive, but in fact lower than the average salary for a chancellor at a public university. This is very likely true, but in the face of tuition increases across the board of such a cash-strapped community of people as public university students, one can't help but wonder if this is the desperate grab for funding that the UC needs to support its students or the desperate grab for cash its administrators demand
