title: Advice for Internz

I've been interning at Microsoft (specifically, Research (even more specifically, the FUSE Labs)) for a few months now (wow that feels weird to say), and one of the most... colorful aspects of my internship has been reading the distribution list for interns ("internz", if you ever find yourself interning at MS and looking for a mailing list to follow; but maybe you'll want to read this first).

I want to say that this mailing list has been absolutely terrible and end it at that, but my advisors have had a positive influence on me (I guess) and I'm realizing that there's something positive to be learned from reading the internz mailing list. Or maybe more accurately, I think there's good advice to take away from it, especially the regrettable messages authors clearly sent without thinking much about the fact that many more people would read than respond to them.

That advice is to think about how you portray yourself on the Internet - and this includes what you say on (nominally) private mailing lists. With more than a thousand interns subscribed to Microsoft's distribution list, many of your future peers (and very likely future superiors) will see what you say on it. It's not *that* big a world out there, and if you say ill-conceived, rude, or just juvenile nonsense on the Internet (whether in emails, or on Twitter, or wherever else), you risk someone remembering you for being an idiot that one time rather than for the long career of diligent work you've put in.

That's not what you need in your life - for a stupid remark to haunt your reputation for years after you made it. It's unfortunate and maybe even unfair, but it is the reality that the Internet makes these things relatively permanent compared to streaking in college, or making a fool of yourself while drunk at some party (I've only done the latter, so don't bother looking; also, gross).

This hasn't been prompted by any single thing in the mailing list (or even at Microsoft; I see it on Twitter with friends/colleagues occasionally too), it just seems like good advice that people don't really think about - even computer scientists, whose research area would suggest that they should know better.

I realize this is short on details and decidedly absent of examples, but I don't think it's fair to round up all the stupid things I see people say on the Internet and chastise them for it (especially on my own blog, where they have no way to respond). Just look at your own timelines, especially if you have colleagues on them, and quickly scan for comments that might be misunderstood or misconstrued, especially later, absent the original context. In some cases you have to accept that comments taken out of context will be misunderstood in the worst way, but I think we can all tell what's walking that line and what's clearly walked past it.

This isn't meant to scare anyone; the action items can be summed thusly (and more optimistically):

- Use your best judgment when you say something on the Internet
- Never get into an argument on the net
- If you feel like you're getting into an argument, go for a walk/bike ride/spin in your chair
- Try to be your best self, always
- Be happy and put that into the world
