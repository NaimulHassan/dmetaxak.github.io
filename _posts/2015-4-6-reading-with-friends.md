This quarter the [HCI][hcigroup] and [Infolab][infolabgroup] groups came together for a weekly reading group thing. Each Monday at noon someone brings a new, *impactful* reading to the group and discusses it for everyone. It's kind of a cool way to get the HCI group - often somewhat ethnographic or qualitative-leaning - and the Infolab - generally more quantitative - together to see where cross-pollination of ideas might happen. We're tentatively calling it "Reading With Friends", but I'm pretty sure we're open to alternative names.

This week was more or less my turn to introduce a paper to the group, so I introduced "What is a flag for? Social media reporting tools and the vocabulary of complaint". Kate Crawford and Tarleton Gillespie authored it in *New Media & Society*, and it shines a light on a really interested topic that I don't think computational social scientists have explored very much yet.

Anyway, my talk notes are available in original [keynote][presentationkeynote] form as well as in [powerpoint (pptx)][presentationpptx] forms. I had a Youtube video in there so I'm reluctant to make a PDF of it, but if someone can't access either option, let me know (contact info below) and I'll accommodate.

I'm quickly identifying a theme in my presentations, and it is [keyboard cat][keyboardcat].
