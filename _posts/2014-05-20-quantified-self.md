For the past year I've been studying the culture of Quantified Self. Last weekend I gave a talk on the research at the [Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program Symposium](http://www.urop.uci.edu/symposium.html), and in the spirit of QS culture (especially with regard to open access to data, etc...) I thought I'd post the presentation. The PowerPoint is [here](/presentations/QS.ppt) (warning: 12.9 MB). Alternatively, you can download a PDF [here](/presentations/QS.pdf) (9.8 MB).
