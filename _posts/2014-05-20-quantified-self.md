For the past year I&#8217;ve been studying the culture of Quantified Self. Last weekend I gave a talk on the research at the [Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program Symposium][1], and in the spirit of QS culture (especially with regard to open access to data, etc&#8230;) I thought I&#8217;d post the presentation. The PowerPoint is [here][2] (warning: 12.9 MB). Alternatively, you can download a PDF [here][3] (9.8 MB).
