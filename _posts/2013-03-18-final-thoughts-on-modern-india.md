This class was ridiculous. I continue to find that these geographically focused Anthro courses are miles away in terms of rigor compared to anything else I&#8217;m taking. I found myself thinking the same things as this quarter came to an end as I felt near the end of Anthro 164P (Eastern Europe and Central Asia):

> Oh god, I don&#8217;t know anything about this region. I&#8217;m a fraud. How can I expect to pass this class? I don&#8217;t know **anything** about this place!

&#8230; and then proceeding to hyperventilate. But I&#8217;m beginning to get savvy to this feeling of not knowing. I know that a big first step in learning about a region or a group of people is the simple fact of knowing that you know so little about a group with so many little nuances, quirks, and exceptions to the rule. At least I know that much now.

This class pleasantly surprised me as well, though. I hadn&#8217;t anticipated a discussion on the ethics of sharing information via Aaron Swartz in the context of this class. I might have expected, to some degree, a conversation about binarism, technology, and the IT industry in India, but I definitely didn&#8217;t think I would be invested in a conversation about it at the meta level I took it to. And I want to emphasize that **I took it to that meta level**. If you know me, you know that I hate getting dragged into that, but this time I dragged **you** there over the course of a series of blog posts. You&#8217;re very welcome. Or thank you. I&#8217;m not sure.

I hardly expected to find myself talking about the race relations of Whites and Blacks in America, but I found over the past ~10 weeks that India and its relationship with Britain paralleled cultures, conflicts, and relationships all over the world in fascinating ways. It&#8217;s one thing to notice those connections, and I would be happy if I came away with that, but the entirely new way of seeing how cultural relations between the West and the &#8220;other&#8221; can share some common ground with other cultures. *Machines and the Measure of Man* got me thinking about the way India and Africa were in the same boat when it came to their relationship with the West: that of marginalization, oversimplification, and misunderstanding.

I hope I can take this new approach and insight with me to other subjects. I feel like I&#8217;ve gained a foothold in a whole area of Anthropology about which I was never really cognizant before. These approaches have certainly made the takeaway from this class that much better, and I can only imagine the same effect on other subjects and regions.
