I've been getting graded really harshly in these lab assignments lately and I'm beginning to feel worse about my ability to code and do well in classes and all of that.

But then I read about [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp0_on_fire); it's an error code jokingly made to indicate that the device was on fire.

I've never set anything on fire with my code. I can be proud of that.

Also my professor laughed at me when I told him I was worried about my grade. Apparently he's planning on curving final scores quite a bit. This made me lose sleep so I'm glad to hear it.
