I&#8217;ve been getting graded really harshly in these lab assignments lately and I&#8217;m beginning to feel worse about my ability to code and do well in classes and all of that.

But then I read about [this][1]; it&#8217;s an error code jokingly made to indicate that the device was on fire.

I&#8217;ve never set anything on fire with my code. I can be proud of that.

Also my professor laughed at me when I told him I was worried about my grade. Apparently he&#8217;s planning on curving final scores quite a bit. This made me lose sleep so I&#8217;m glad to hear it.
