I&#8217;ve been poring over this paper on the economic structures of various social networking sites. It&#8217;s actually really interesting how the reciprocal economy on Twitter (Follow Friday, Follow Back, etc&#8230;) contrasts with market economic systems like Quora&#8217;s credit system, Reddit&#8217;s upvotes, and others.

And the range of economies on social networking sites &#8211; LinkedIn, Facebook, StackOverflow, et al &#8211; is really staggering once you start looking for them through the lens of economic systems.

This illustration is ugly as sin, but it&#8217;s illustrative of an interesting relationship; people on Twitter suspiciously stick close to the 1:1 ratio all the way along the "status count" axis, meaning that if you&#8217;re new to Twitter or an old veteran with 5000+ posts, you&#8217;re more likely to follow exactly as many people as follow you than anything else.

A pretty picture will be forthcoming. I need to work on making this programmatic. Do I want to do it in R or Python? Input might be welcome.
