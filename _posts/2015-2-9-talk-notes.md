Recently I was asked to talk about a paper to the [SNAP][1] group, and I couldn't help but choose an Anthro paper. Here are the very low-quality notes that I prepared for the paper I gave everyone ("[The Anthropology of Online Communities][2]").

- Overview: this is mostly a review of a fair amount of Anthro literature on online communities and cultures, so it's fairly high level and doesn't offer very much new research *per se*, but for someone looking to survey the field for worthwhile theories to reference (or just anecdotes to use in the intro), this is hopefully a good choice
- Anthropologists interested in online cultures for a lot of the same reasons that data/computer scientists are interested in culture ("...millions of users linked..." (pg 449))
- At the time this was a *new* domain to Anthropology
- Optimism and pessimism regarding technology and the future, but no mention of Foucault?!
- Where's my panopticon?
- Some hilarious glossary (World Wide Web, CD ROM, etc...)

## The Internet as a site of cultural (re)production
- Bringing "cyberspace" research back into the conventional social sciences into negotiating gendered, geographical, racialized, etc... identities
- Text analyses represent just "...one of many available mediated communication technologies on the Internet..." (pg 454)
- Difficulty in identifying a coherent community (pg 455++)
  - *infolab has its own thoughts on that (community detection, etc...)*
  - the idea here is that people can be part of multiple communities; one's centrality can be non-monotonic.
- community heterogeneity (Appadurai 1991)
- Maybe the notion of [MINER][3]'s heterogeneity as applied to communities is too distinct and needs to account for this softness
- Relating online interactions with offline interactions is necessary (pg 456)
  - The notion that cultures were completely face-to-face has been under fire for decades (Anderson 1984, Basch et al. 1994, Hannerz 1996)
- Focus on the dichotomies of offline-online
- Ephemerality(!)
- Identity, Communication, Power Ideology and Access
- Ethical Considerations
