<p>I&rsquo;m a little more than a week into the Fall session at UC Irvine, and I&rsquo;m struggling to find meaningful activities to fill my time. I&rsquo;m taking 16 units, found a part time job, and am exploring Alpha Phi Omega (a community service fraternity) and Circle K International (also a community service organization, but this one a club), but I still don&rsquo;t feel like there&rsquo;s enough going on this quarter. I&rsquo;ve reached out to the undergraduate research adviser in the Anthropology department, but it seems that the professors I would be interested in working with are all busy or away at the moment. I&rsquo;ll need to wait until the Winter quarter to consider even exploring research with them.</p>

<p>I tried out for Mock Trial at UCI but didn&rsquo;t get a callback. That was a blow for me; I never realized how rusty I had gotten in speech since I stopped doing speech and debate in high school. I&rsquo;ll have to focus on other things. I need not to dwell on the rejections.</p>

<p>Anthropology classes here are different from Foothill; at one point they&rsquo;re more advanced but simultaneously they feel less substantive. Sometimes it&rsquo;s as though the professor has little experience, or hasn&rsquo;t prepared for their own lectures. It also doesn&rsquo;t help that attendance is pretty much optional (at your own risk). The labs and discussions are what&rsquo;s not optional, but those are <em>good</em>. I get to interact with graduate students in small groups. They&rsquo;re engaged. They enjoy the subject.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting into Python (the language of choice for the programming circuit I&rsquo;m taking), and I&rsquo;m getting into it quite a bit. I&rsquo;ve worked out how to tweet from my command line, but I&rsquo;m still not sure how to bring it all together, make it work for others, or present it in a reasonable interface. Still&hellip; not that bad for 1 week, right?</p>

<p>Maybe.</p>
