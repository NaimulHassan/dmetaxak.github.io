  Anthropology classes here are different from Foothill; at one point they're more advanced but simultaneously they feel less substantive. Sometimes it's as though the professor has little experience, or hasn't prepared for their own lectures. It also doesn't help that attendance is pretty much optional (at your own risk). The labs and discussions are what's not optional, but those are <i>good</i>. I get to interact with graduate students in small groups. They're engaged. They enjoy the subject.

  I've been getting into Python (the language of choice for the programming circuit I'm taking), and I'm getting into it quite a bit. I've worked out how to tweet from my command line, but I'm still not sure how to bring it all together, make it work for others, or present it in a reasonable interface. Still&#8230; not that bad for 1 week, right?
