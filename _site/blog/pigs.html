<p>Today was my second day of lab/babysitting sick people so that Vanessa can hopefully get some work done. Yesterday&rsquo;s catalog was easy - making a catalog of artifact fragments on which we&rsquo;ll be doing XRF analysis (someday), but today I was tasked with cleaning the recent finds from the field, mostly ceramics caked in hard dirt.</p>

<p>The weather here is best described as inconsistent, or perhaps consistently erratic. There&rsquo;s no way of predicting what today&rsquo;s climate will look like, so you&rsquo;re supposed to prepare for a little bit of everything. In Spanish, the word to describe the drizzle which sometimes showers us with light rain is called &ldquo;paramo&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Yesterday Matt, Sofia, others, and I considered places to go for our upcoming 3-day weekend. The other staff members mentioned going to various resort locations like Mindo or BaNos, but I&rsquo;m not sure that I don&rsquo;t feel like splitting from the group and going somewhere difficult on my own. I considered Colombia, but I&rsquo;m on the fence because of the reported danger to American tourists. Then again, a guy&rsquo;s gotta live, right?</p>

<p>After lunch today my ceramics cleaning partner (Kenny) and I noticed a fire near the hacienda rooms, so we put the fire out. I should remind myself later to update my LinkedIn profile to say &ldquo;Archaeologist, firefighter&rdquo;.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s some trouble with the databases, not just in that there are multiple databases but in that people are actually having trouble with them. I&rsquo;m considering pushing to MySQL/PHP, which should be easier to use but might be harder to learn. I need to come up with a solution which is easy enough to learn.</p>

<p>The pigs at this hacienda almost ate some of our ceramics. Stupid pigs.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t help but start to feel the impact of knowing that I won&rsquo;t see some people back home very much (if at all). I don&rsquo;t mind losing some people, but others&hellip;</p>
