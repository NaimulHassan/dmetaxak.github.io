<p>These past several days have been difficult. Yesterday UC Irvine notified me that they had not yet received my college transcripts, and were thus putting a hold on my registration. I&rsquo;m not sure how that impacts my Summer Start registration for classes (which have been processed and confirmed), but HOPEFULLY they&rsquo;ll keep that registration intact on the premise that I will resolve this issue. Eventually.</p>

<p>Truthfully, I don&rsquo;t know if I can do enough from Ecuador by email to make things work in time. I emailed my dad, but neither he nor the person in charge of transcript orders is responding to my contact. I&rsquo;m nervous about coming back to the states and finding hat I lost my admission to UC Irvine. I can&rsquo;t take another setback like that. I just can&rsquo;t handle it.</p>

<p>The lab can&rsquo;t be worked out in time either, I&rsquo;m afraid. The database stil lists over 380 duplicate entries, and each duplicate requires almost an hour of investigation before I can get an idea of what the source of the problem is. There are not enough hours left in the project for me to do this.</p>

<p>The blog is apparently not getting enough posts, but the students are overworked and can&rsquo;t be pushed much harder than they already are. Still, I need to find a way for the students to post.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m stressed out. I&rsquo;m beginning to miss home more.</p>
