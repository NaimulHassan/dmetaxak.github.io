Despite being sick and the trip being rather rigorous &ndash; about an hour in rough mountain roads in the back of a truck followed by a steep hike up a mountin trail &ndash; I enjoyed the excursion very much. &ldquo;D-Bro&rdquo; (as we called him) drove like a maniac, even by Ecuadorian/Latin standards, and he led the pace for the hike. The man&rsquo;s age belies his youthfulness. Surveying was fantastic &ndash; and not just because the views were incredible. Seeing a potential new site &ndash; literally discovering a site right at that moment &ndash; was thrilling. I felt out of my depth, but this doesn&rsquo;t surprise me much since my area is Cultural Anthropology, not Archaeology. Getting back, being hungry, and waiting for dinner is/was less fun. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind fast-forwarding to tomorrow night (both to further reduce this sickness and to see others on the project again). I can feel myself losing patience with others on this trip, but I don&rsquo;t know if this is a culture shock or something more genuine; I feel like I&rsquo;m justified in being annoyed with some self-aggrandizing, over-eager-to-please idiot singing all day and night. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I hate when people sing out of nowhere regardless of where I am. I must sound like a scrooge. I should end on a positive note. I am excited to take a week off, then start at UC Irvine and hopefully get a new Macbook Pro with a &ldquo;Retina Display&rdquo;.">
