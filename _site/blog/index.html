        <p>Over the past several weeks I&rsquo;ve been reading articles and books describing the relationship between Colonial Britain and India during the 19th and 20th centuries. In all of these readings, I&rsquo;ve noticed a thread that seems to connect every anecdote and interaction between the West and the &ldquo;other&rdquo; from then until now: The &ldquo;West&rdquo;, assured of its own superiority and set in its views about what is “good” versus “bad”, imposed its binary paradigm on India in an effort both to pigeonhole Indian culture but also to reckon with the subtle, sometimes confusing, often contradictory aspects of Indian culture.</p>

        <p>With the Fall quarter finally over, I find I actually have time to blog. Great. I also find that I have time to run more, clean up around the apartment, brood over my sloven flatmate, and run some more. </p>
<div>
  <i>Great.</i> <p />
  
  <div>
    It's not all bad. I'm still grateful that I made it through the gauntlet of essays (at one point I was averaging 2 a day and some of them were fairly long and involved) and exams, and I'm reasonably satisfied with how they came out. I say that now, of course; I'm sure I'll be kicking myself when I get my grades. I'm trying to look on the positive sides of things and remind myself that these essays might have done just fine and I'd be keeping my As in all of my classes if that's the case. It's just that the fear of coming in anything under top marks makes me anxious.
  </div>
  
  <p />
  
  <div>
    I digress. Recently I've been getting some good news:
  </div>
  
  <p />
  
  <div>
    I was selected to take part in a <b>Multidisciplinary Design Program</b>, which I'm going to call MDP from now on because I hate typing that whole thing out. The MDP is a research project for people interested in doing work that involves a number of different fields. It's great because this particular project incorporates the Informatics department and uses ethnographic methods to learn more about how people use space on campus.
  </div>
  
  <p />
  
  <div>
    So yeah, this is my kind of research project.
  </div>
  
  <p />
  
  <div>
    It would be even more ideal if the two departments involved were Informatics and <i>Anthropology</i> (rather than Planning, Policy, &amp; Design &#8211; in the school of Social Ecology), but seeing as there were <b>no</b> MDP projects involving Anthropology <i>or</i> Sociology, I'll take what I can get.
  </div>
  
  <p />
  
  <div>
    I was also selected as a <b>transfer student liaison for the Associated Students of UC Irvine</b>, the undergraduate government body at UCI. I'm tentatively putting this in the back of my mind because there might be a scheduling conflict that prevents me from taking part, and in that case I <i>won't</i> be a transfer student liaison. I've emailed the president and notified her of the conflict, and hopefully she'll either give me a pass or we'll figure something else out. Realistically, I might have to step back from that potential role. It's unfortunate, but I'd rather put classes ahead of any individual opportunity to do extracurriculars.
  </div>
  
  <p />
  
  <div>
    On the side, I've been keeping up somewhat with this <b>blasted Twitter app</b>, but it might receive more attention over the next few weeks since I'll be spending more time at home and with family. Some things that need work still:
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Retweeting functionality
      </li>
      <li>
        Proper display of retweets
      </li>
      <li>
        Follow/unfollow options
      </li>
      <li>
        Display user's stats properly
      </li>
      <li>
        Proper replies (I forgot if I fixed this)
      </li>
      <li>
        Config file encryption*
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <div>
      *Someone insisted that my configuration file (which contains my Twitter oAuth credentials as well as the user's Access tokens) be encrypted. I understand the rationale for this, but I'm not sure how to encrypt it in a truly secure way. If someone wants to break into the application somehow, I'm really at a loss for what I can do to prevent them from getting the plaintext results. Maybe I'm just not thinking of the proper solution. Maybe the whole point is to make it hard enough that a cursory scan of the user's config files won't reveal everything.
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <p />
  
  <div>
    I'll keep working on it and see what I can get done. I wanted to kill the project because the Terminal &#8211; while kind of obscure &#8211; isn't an ideal setting to interact with a stream of data from the internet. Things interrupt your input and that makes everything look bad. Maybe there's a solution but I'm not bothering to look for it. In any case, I'd rather just make my own GUI that works the way I want it to work. It's unfortunate that by this point my Java course had gotten around to teaching us user interfaces (if briefly), but the Python class never got there by the end of the quarter. Naturally I'm expecting the second course in the series to get there, but that puts this course on a slower pace than the Java class circuit I started at my community college, lending credence to my feelings that UCI isn't as rigorous as my community college (and making me feel worse about not being at a "top" university).
  </div>
  
  <p />
  
  <div>
    And yes, I know UCI is a "top" university by many measures. I mean top ~20 (Berkeley's 21, but as close as any UC gets and good enough).
  </div>
  
  <p />
  
  <div>
    In any event, I've been looking into Tk and some other UI frameworks, and I've sketched out a few ideas for user interface paradigms that I still like after a few days of looking at them and critiquing them. Those are awesome signs; usually I hate my ideas after a few days ruminating on them. At some point in the next few weeks I'll make some vectors or something and upload them here so the idea is actually out in public. If someone feels like copying my ideas, feel free. A hat tip to me would be nice.

  <p>
     <p />
    This seemed like an interesting and inexplicably neglected issue to me. How do people prune whom they follow? You're in a bit of a catch-22 since you regularly see people who are active, but inactive people are rarely seen. 
    <p />
    
    <div>
      I've been thinking about it, and it can't be too hard to put something together that would work for a user's needs. There could be an adjustable threshold where you say "if the person hasn't tweeted in x days, show them in the list". Even more, this could display those users' last tweet (or few tweets), just in case they're sporadic users of Twitter but still tweet stuff you're interested in consistently.
    </div>
    
    <p />
    
    <div>
      I wonder how Twitter's new API guidelines will deal with this, but I suspect this won't be such a big deal. I'm such an obscure person I'll be shocked if I reach 100k users, heh.

        <p>I&rsquo;m a little more than a week into the Fall session at UC Irvine, and I&rsquo;m struggling to find meaningful activities to fill my time. I&rsquo;m taking 16 units, found a part time job, and am exploring Alpha Phi Omega (a community service fraternity) and Circle K International (also a community service organization, but this one a club), but I still don&rsquo;t feel like there&rsquo;s enough going on this quarter. I&rsquo;ve reached out to the undergraduate research adviser in the Anthropology department, but it seems that the professors I would be interested in working with are all busy or away at the moment. I&rsquo;ll need to wait until the Winter quarter to consider even exploring research with them. </p>

  I tried out for Mock Trial at UCI but didn't get a callback. That was a blow for me; I never realized how rusty I had gotten in speech since I stopped doing speech and debate in high school. I'll have to focus on other things. I need not to dwell on the rejections.

        <p>I&rsquo;ve been pretty fortunate with my first quarter at UC Irvine, particularly in that the classes I&rsquo;m taking feed directly into my interests. That might seem like a very low bar for satisfaction, but consider that there are hundreds of classes offered (admittedly maybe only a dozen or so in Anthropology) and I could be taking any of those classes instead. More likely than not there would be some irrelevant classes where I was putting in a significant amount of work for something ultimately not related to my goals. More troublingly, though, is that I could be in a class where nothing meaningful got done. </p>
<div>
  That would be a waste of units &#8211; time <i>and</i> money, in my case &#8211; and I'd be pretty upset about that.

        <p>These past four or five days I&rsquo;ve been getting sicker and sicker, so today I decided to quickly deal with whatever I have rather than fight it on my own over a longer period of time. The doctor experience was odd. There was nothing profoundly different about the place; it just felt off. The doctor&rsquo;s office itself was more like a business office than a medical office, with his own desk separating himself from patients. His desk was covered in paperwork, upon which was resting a prescription pad, making it seem like his job was more about writing prescriptions and doing paperwork than it was about being with and interacting with his patients. 
I had two infections: one bacterial and one viral. The doctor wanted to have a follow-up meeting on Tuesday because of the bacterial infection. 
I came back to the lab to work on the catalog and today I started inventorying the artifact bags from various operations. I got about halfway through operation 40, found about 30 bags with erroneous and duplicate cataog IDs. 
This 3-day weekend I plan on staying in. Duh.</p>

        <p>These past several days have been difficul. Yesterday UC Irvine notified me that they had not yet received my college transcripts, and were thus putting a hold on my registration. I&rsquo;m not sure how that impacts my Summer Start registration for classes (which have been processed and confirmed), but HOPEFULLY they&rsquo;ll keep that registration intact on the premise that I will resolve this issue. Eventually. 
Truthfully, I don&rsquo;t know if I can do enough from Ecuador by email to make things work in time. I emailed my dad, but neither he nor the person in charge of transcript orders is responding to my contact. I&rsquo;m nervous about coming back to the states and finding hat I lost my admission to UC Irvine. I can&rsquo;t take another setback like that. I just can&rsquo;t handle it. 
The lab can&rsquo;t be worked out in time either, I&rsquo;m afraid. The database stil lists over 380 duplicate entries, and each duplicate requires almost an hour of investigation before I can get an idea of what the source of the problem is. There are not enough hours left in the project for me to do this. 
The blog is apparently not getting enough posts, but the students are overworked and can&rsquo;t be pushed much harder than they already are. Still, I need to find a way for the students to post. 
I&rsquo;m stressed out. I&rsquo;m beginning to miss home more.</p>

        <p>After self-prepared dinner last night (french toast and eggs), the group of students staying at la Conventa played drinking games late into the night. I decided to turn in early because I was still feeling sick. 
This morning I woke up early and had some eggs prepared by Scott from Buffalo. Will and some others had arranged to visit a site with Dr. David Brown (formerly of UT at Austin), and they invited me, so I went. How often do you get to survey with David Brown? 
Despite being sick and the trip being rather rigorous &ndash; about an hour in rough mountain roads in the back of a truck followed by a steep hike up a mountin trail &ndash; I enjoyed the excursion very much. &ldquo;D-Bro&rdquo; (as we called him) drove like a maniac, even by Ecuadorian/Latin standards, and he led the pace for the hike. The man&rsquo;s age belies his youthfulness. 
Surveying was fantastic &ndash; and not just because the views were incredible. Seeing a potential new site &ndash; literally discovering a site right at that moment &ndash; was thrilling. I felt out of my depth, but this doesn&rsquo;t surprise me much since my area is Cultural Anthropology, not Archaeology. 
Getting back, being hungry, and waiting for dinner is/was less fun. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind fast-forwarding to tomorrow night (both to further reduce this sickness and to see others on the project again). 
I can feel myself losing patience with others on this trip, but I don&rsquo;t know if this is a culture shock or something more genuine; I feel like I&rsquo;m justified in being annoyed with some self-aggrandizing, over-eager-to-please idiot singing all day and night. 
I&rsquo;m pretty sure I hate when people sing out of nowhere regardless of where I am. 
I must sound like a scrooge. I should end on a positive note. 
I am excited to take a week off, then start at UC Irvine and hopefully get a new Macbook Pro with a &ldquo;Retina Display&rdquo;.</p>

        <p>The music here pounds through the ground when you walk the streets of Cangahua during a festival. A sea of modestly decorated Andean hats, worn by men and women alike (but adorned by women with a colorful feather, cover the sidewalks and parts of the streets themselves. Others, dressed in ornate and colorful masks, lead a parade which seems to weave throughout the city but focuses on the main street leading up the hill. Behind them follows a truck, outfitted with speakers larger than the musicians and singers who play adjacent to and on the backs of the trucks. Everyone here is a participant. No one, it seems, is just going about their business as usual today. This may be the largest fiesta of the year; it seems like the longest. 
The party lasts well through the day, past sunset, dusk, and into the night. The central plaza, which had always been playing music and hosting a variety of street foods, turns into a focal point for live music, dancing, and drinking. More masked dancers appear, more food and drink carts establish themselves, and the bands eventually set up their equipment and play for la gente de Cangahua and los Gringos alike. 
The food carts quietly cook pig, chicken, and other more ambiguous meats, fanning the smoke in part to help cook the food but mostly, it seems, to entice passersby. Drink carts scattered throughout the plaza offer a drink called Canelaso &ndash; a citrus-flavored moonshine drink which is served warm and belies its alcohol content. Pilsener &ndash; a revolting beer which has secured itself a monopolistic position in Cangahua (if not most of Ecuador) is served as well, but it seems less popular than the salive-based Canelaso. Rightly so; Canelaso tastes much better, regardless of any squeamishness surrounding a drink based on saliva. 
The staff partied until past 1AM; I relented and slept early but woke up a few hours later, restless from the music in the plaza &ndash; easily audible from over a mile away. I fear I&rsquo;ve missed an important event in staff bonding, but I need to have some faith in my own intuition. I wasn&rsquo;t going to remain happy if I stayed out there for 2-3 more hours. I can&rsquo;t force myself to drink that much Pilsener.</p>

        <p>After a brutally cold shower and a casual, delicious breakfast, the staff organized to discuss last-minute logistics before the students arrived. &ldquo;The Bed Crew&rdquo; &ndash; consisting of Sofia, Matt, Daniel, and myself &ndash; expanded to a group of 8 and raced to dinish assembling beds for students participating in the &ldquo;homestay&rdquo; program, wherein students stay with locals for the duratioof the program. 
The students arrived and settled their things. Over lunch, we discussed necessary tips (pace yourself, assimilate with the culture, etc&hellip;) and turned them loose with only a requirement that the students be back by 7 for dinner (and staff be present for the subsequent staff meeting). 
Festivities seemed to die down today, which was unsurprising given that last night&rsquo;s party seemed to knock out the power for the entire city for most of the day. Daniel and I wandered around the town, spotting graffiti on the walls which referenced hip-hop and rapping. Eventually we came upon a group of people at the summet of one of the hills. They were celebrating la dia de Santa Isabel. 
The people at this celebration looked incredible. Cowboy chaps, reverse-face masks, whips, musical instruments, beer, and an intricate dance resembling the symbolic passing of the sun from east to west (and the moon from west to east). All of it was choreographed perfectly, everyone played their part forming a cohesive circle. Later in the town plaza we saw much more: hundreds of people dressed in colorful costumes, playfully brandishing whips and drinking beer. 
Here at the plaza, people walked around selling treats to on-lookers. I bought some dough balls which seemed reminiscent of doughnut holes, but these tasted more like they were based on some egg recipe.</p>

        <p>This morning we went to Quitoloma and explored the site. The bus ride was uneventful, except for the revelation that Sofia seems to have a boyfriend. I feel distinctly like there are too few eligible single women in the world. 
Quitoloma was a struggle in many ways. The heat of the sun was brutal, the hike was incredibly difficult, and I was upset that the tall grass fields covering the mountain made for a more comfortable bed than the bed I sleep in now (or the bed I have back home, for that matter). 
That&rsquo;s no good. I need a grass bed when I get home. 
The ride back was in one of the trucks, but on the way back we encountered a landslide which blocked our road. So we spent a few hours cleaning that and getting the bus out when it got stuck. It was intensive work, but immensely rewarding when we cleared the bus of the mud and dirt in which it got stuck. 
Dinner included fried plantains, so my life was good. Later when discussing project ideas, I found out that Eric does statistical analysis. Angus and Daniel are involved in resistence cultures, so between Angus/Daniel &amp; Vanessa (in the lab)/Eric, I&rsquo;ll have lots to research this summer. 
We had an emergency staff meeting today, where we addressed some problems which had come up this week. Ryan got upset at the specific outing of people&rsquo;s misbehavior, and I shared his sentiments. Same later shot me down for talking tohim about it later, and I see his perspective (which he described as a need to identify and deal with specific issues immediately), but I personally disagree with his position that we should therefore name people and point out exactly what they did wrong in a group of 30-40 people. It sets a bad first impression of the student for the other staff, which the student now needs to overcome &ndash; which is impossible given the number of staff members. 
This doesn&rsquo;t bother me as much as it bothers Ryan, who said he was willing to quit the field school over this treatment of a student&rsquo;s privacy. Personally, I&rsquo;m living in a room with 7/8 other people, so&hellip; &ldquo;what privacy?&rdquo; is my response to that. 
Later, Angus and I discussed Ecuador&rsquo;s political and social history and the formation of the rose plantations and that industry (by which I mean that he schooled me on Ecuadorian history). We got cut short by quiet hours, but will hopefully continue that discussion later.</p>

        <p>This morning the students and staff went to survey (by transect) the areas between Cangahua and the Hacienda/Lab. My group was assigned to 16 degrees(???) and we headed north from our dropoff point. 
The hike lasted about six hours. Around five hours in, the cliff dropped off sharply and we had to descend more slowly. The incine was approximately 70 degrees in some parts, and the ground was poor for walking. 
Later in the day, we arrived home in Cangahua and had dinner. After filling up on food, I took a shower &ndash; the first since Sunday. On the way to the shower, Sam stopped me and told me that I was getting a C in his Anthropology 2A class because he didn&rsquo;t have my final paper. I told him I sent it to him, and he said he would re-check, but it was still disconcerting.<br />
When I got back from the shower, the laptop would not boot. It appears that the boot drive is corrupted, and there does not appear to be any way to fix it here in Ecuador, and certainly not in Cangahua. I&rsquo;m going to give it a day or two &ndash; maybe some time will resolve the issue (magically) &ndash; before admitting that the laptop is dead. 
I need to come up with a way to save photos from my camera in the meantime. Carrying a laptop which doesn&rsquo;t work will also be a major burden. I would like this issue resolved immediately. 
I&rsquo;m upset that my work from this trip is gone, particularly since I was excited to work with Vanessa on cluster analysis. I feel rather useless, given my plans, without my laptop. I need to fix that. 
Tomorrow we&rsquo;ll be hiking in Quitoloma, so I should plan on being ready for that tomorrow.<br />
Maybe my laptop dying is not so bad. I&rsquo;ve said I wanted a reason to justify getting a Macbook Pro with Retina Display, and this is as good a reason as any to get one.<br />
Still, this feeling of uselessness sucks.</p>
