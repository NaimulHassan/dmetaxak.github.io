    <div class="excerpt">
        <p>A few days ago Jawbone announced a new revision of their activity tracker called the UP. This one is called the <a href="//jawbone.com/store/buy/up3">UP3</a> and as you can probably imagine, it&rsquo;s their third generation device. I used their second generation device - the UP24 - for a number of months while studying the culture of Quantified Self (at this point linked enough times that I&rsquo;ll just say &ldquo;google it&rdquo; if you want to read it), and I think that from that perspective I have some insight into the sorts of things they need to do to remain true to their QS roots, gain some budding self-quantifiers, and win precious wrist-space from new and old competitors.</p>

    <div class="excerpt">
        <p>Jure Leskovec has been teaching CS 224W this quarter, and a number of his lectures have used research questions to illustrate the concepts and models that he&rsquo;s been teaching. It&rsquo;s been an interesting way of surveying the kind of research he does, which is hopefully informative for anyone planning on rotating into Jure&rsquo;s lab (e.g. me). Recently, he talked about a question of predicting Wikipedia admin elections, and described the results of some research wherein he found that, by accounting for voter-candidate similarity and for status difference (again, between the voter and the candidate), you can predict the outcome of the election just by knowing <em>which</em> 5 people came out to vote first with ~70% reliability; this, without knowing <strong>for whom</strong> they voted. Knowing their votes, you can predict with approximately 85% accuracy. By looking at voters 1-10 (again, not the votes, just the turnout), accuracy rises to 75%, after which point accuracy rises negligibly - even with all voters.</p>

        <p>Last week in <a href="//hci.stanford.edu/courses/cs547/">CS 547</a> <a href="//glow-wacky.com/">David Glowacki</a> gave a talk about some <a href="//danceroom-spec.com/">technology</a> that his lab developed which allowed people to use Kinect (and incidentally LeapMotion) to view the effect that their bodies - as sort of &ldquo;force imprints&rdquo; on a canvas (the background) - have on particles bouncing around arbitrarily. It was really interesting seeing a serious implementation of Kinect and LeapMotion that really seemed to have legs, since I&rsquo;m generally kind of skeptical of the appeal of these full-body user interface devices (almost as much as I am about voice interfaces, although my opinion on that has been changing recently as I&rsquo;ve biked to work/class and wanted to know things that only Siri could tell me).</p>

That might seem like a very low bar for satisfaction, but consider that there are hundreds of classes offered (admittedly maybe only a dozen or so in Anthropology) and I could be taking any of those classes instead. More likely than not there would be some irrelevant classes where I was putting in a significant amount of work for something ultimately not related to my goals. More troublingly, though, is that I could be in a class where nothing meaningful got done.

  That would be a waste of units - time <i>and</i> money, in my case - and I&rsquo;d be pretty upset about that.

        <p><em>I was a little drunk when I wrote this, sitting in a Beatles-themed dive bar in Quito while yelling over some Beatles hit to get this point across, so bear with me. Also, immediately afterwards we wandered into a bar where we danced with an English dude who I&rsquo;m pretty sure was on cocaine. So my memory might be skewed by that whole experience.</em>  </p>

        <p>These past several days have been difficult. Yesterday UC Irvine notified me that they had not yet received my college transcripts, and were thus putting a hold on my registration. I&rsquo;m not sure how that impacts my Summer Start registration for classes (which have been processed and confirmed), but HOPEFULLY they&rsquo;ll keep that registration intact on the premise that I will resolve this issue. Eventually.</p>

        <p>These past four or five days I&rsquo;ve been getting sicker and sicker, so today I decided to quickly deal with whatever I have rather than fight it on my own over a longer period of time. The doctor experience was odd. There was nothing profoundly different about the place; it just felt off. The doctor&rsquo;s office itself was more like a business office than a medical office, with his own desk separating himself from patients. His desk was covered in paperwork, upon which was resting a prescription pad, making it seem like his job was more about writing prescriptions and doing paperwork than it was about being with and interacting with his patients.</p>

Breakfast was hectic and a lot of silverware and cups were left out. In hindsight, I realize that the ladies have probably been cleaning up for us this entire time. How they have patience for us is astounding.</p>

        <p>The music here pounds through the ground when you walk the streets of Cangahua during a festival. A sea of modestly decorated Andean hats, worn by men and women alike (but adorned by women with a colorful feather, cover the sidewalks and parts of the streets themselves. Others, dressed in ornate and colorful masks, lead a parade which seems to weave throughout the city but focuses on the main street leading up the hill. Behind them follows a truck, outfitted with speakers larger than the musicians and singers who play adjacent to and on the backs of the trucks. Everyone here is a participant. No one, it seems, is just going about their business as usual today. This may be the largest fiesta of the year; it seems like the longest.</p>

        <p>I landed in Quito with another student without incident. Our incident was awaiting us, since I had recently received an email from the hostel I booked, telling me they were actually completely full. After a few different flights, we both found ourselves landing in Quito at the same time and we decided to head into town to look for a hostel like any other dumb tourists - by walking door to door. </p>

        <p>I tend to find this happening a lot more near the end of the year than anytime else (big surprise), but I&rsquo;m beginning to feel burnt out from this past year - or more directly, this past year. After wrapping up three full-size studies on campus, tutoring a handful of kids in introductory stats, and getting back rejection letters from my top UC choices, I have to admit that I&rsquo;ve lost some motivation. </p>
