<p>Jure Leskovec has been teaching CS 224W this quarter, and a number of his lectures have used research questions to illustrate the concepts and models that he&rsquo;s been teaching. It&rsquo;s been an interesting way of surveying the kind of research he does, which is hopefully informative for anyone planning on rotating into Jure&rsquo;s lab (e.g. me). Recently, he talked about a question of predicting Wikipedia admin elections, and described the results of some research wherein he found that, by accounting for voter-candidate similarity and for status difference (again, between the voter and the candidate), you can predict the outcome of the election just by knowing <em>which</em> 5 people came out to vote first with ~70% reliability; this, without knowing <strong>for whom</strong> they voted. Knowing their votes, you can predict with approximately 85% accuracy. By looking at voters 1-10 (again, not the votes, just the turnout), accuracy rises to 75%, after which point accuracy rises negligibly - even with all voters.</p>

<p>This was really fascinating, but ~70% is not <em>great</em>, and there&rsquo;s certainly room for improvement. I asked if looking at different subsets of votes (voters 2-6 instead of 1-5, for instance) would yield different predictive accuracy. It didn&rsquo;t seem like this had been pursued, but I suspect that sock puppet voters and the like might be less representative of the overall outcome for an election, making voters 1-n (where n is small) more noise than signal.</p>

<p>If anyone is interested in following up on this question, I&rsquo;m certainly interested in seeing if I&rsquo;m right.</p>
