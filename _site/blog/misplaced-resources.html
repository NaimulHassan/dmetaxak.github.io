<article class="full">
<p>I spent way too much time making this stupid lab look right (and don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it looks great and accounts for nearly every stupid little thing someone could possibly think up), and I realized that I got a higher grade on a proposal I turned in for another class, meaning I actually <em>could have</em> gotten an A in it when before I thought it would take a miracle to accomplish.</p>

<p>So I turned in a bizarre crazy essay (basically the equivalent of a gambit) for that latter class, which may not be received well.</p>

<p>And I find myself tweaking my stupid simple site so much that you&rsquo;d really think I was obsessive or something. Hah.</p>

<p>Every CS student who finally completes their derivative Othello/Reversi game is unbelievably proud of themselves after finishing it, and I&rsquo;m no different. Look at it, isn&rsquo;t it great? I don&rsquo;t care that the new game dialog window persists when you start the game. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that like 10% of the class cheated so the fact that I have an academically honest, fully functional program seems like grad student level work.</p>

<p>In fact, maybe it stands a little higher than <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/12/the-data-vigilante/309172/">graduate level work</a>, apparently.</p>
