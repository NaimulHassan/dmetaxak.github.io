<p>I was sorting through some work I did during Spring quarter and despite taking about twice as many units as anyone else I knew (and more in the case of a few people), I managed to churn out a few kind of interesting ideas.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how to determine which graduate schools I should apply to (among other things that might come out in the next few months as I get more time to reflect and write), and one of the things that came up was that I needed a good way to assess the quality of a department according to some criterion (or criteria). Academia has already taken a shot at that with this score aggregation formula called an h-index or something like that. It seems to bring together freshness, impact, and other factors to come up with one reasonable number for each individual faculty member.</p>

<p>The problem was that this didn&rsquo;t provide a good insight on the university as a whole, and even where you could aggregate everything into one descriptive statistic, it was still questionable whether it was an accurate estimation of the university&rsquo;s quality, which is something you just kind of <em>feel</em>. So in the same way that you might determine that a polygraph test machine wasn&rsquo;t right because it wasn&rsquo;t identifying liars as much as it was identifying people who were ashamed of what they were talking about (or otherwise uncomfortable, and thus exhibiting traits mistaken for liar&rsquo;s traits), I wasn&rsquo;t sure that the h-index was an accurate measurement itself. But to tease that out, I&rsquo;d need to visualize that data in a way that made inconsistencies pretty glaring.<br />
<a href="http://ali-alkhatib.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/HCI.png" rel="attachment wp-att-97"><img width="100%" src="http://ali-alkhatib.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/HCI.png" alt="" title="hci-png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-97" /></a></p>

<p>I came up with this illustration. It&rsquo;s a very visual way of viewing information which I hoped was a little more informational than&hellip; well, any array of numbers could be. You can see how many people are at a university and what level of impact they seem to have on the community as a whole. As a clever little idea, I used the overall average to determine the size of the name next to the university; Harvard&rsquo;s name would be much bigger if the plethora of researchers they had were as big names as the 2 or 3 who otherwise dominate their faculty. Same with Georgia Tech. Columbia and CWRU have disproportionately large names because their 1-member faculty produces an average that is <em>entirely</em> dependent on them. That one person does well and it looks like they&rsquo;re more impressive since &ldquo;their entire faculty&rdquo; has a significant impact in the field of HCI. Not very fair.</p>

<p>I also made one for CSCW, which showed a more diverse group when you look at this different focus:<br />
<a href="http://ali-alkhatib.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/CSCW.png" rel="attachment wp-att-96"><img width="100%" src="http://ali-alkhatib.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/CSCW.png" alt="" title="cscw-png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-96" /></a></p>

<p>I was interested to find that relatively few universities got inflated reputations (except maybe Columbia and Harvard), and there were a lot of universities with a few &ldquo;rock stars&rdquo; surrounded by, er&hellip; dwarf stars, I suppose.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if the h index is a <em>bad</em> way to assess the quality of a university&rsquo;s researchers, but it&rsquo;s certainly good to get a grasp of the university through a given metric in a quick and intuitive way. There are big fish in academia and if we can assess a field at a glance and see that something is just &ldquo;off&rdquo;, we can tell that we need to rework the formula we&rsquo;re using to formalize the quality of the institution. If someone sees all this and thinks &ldquo;woah, [some university] shouldn&rsquo;t be that [big/small]&rdquo; just from glancing at it, that tells us to keep looking for a good indicator.</p>

<p>Or set of indicators.</p>

<p>Or to give up and just trust the poison chicken. Anyone got any strychnine?</p>
