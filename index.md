Hi, that's me.

I'm a PhD student in the Computer Science department at Stanford University.

Last quarter I was working in [Jure Leskovec][jure]'s lab (the [InfoLab][infolab]). This quarter I'm working with [Dan Jurafsky][DJ] in the [Linguistics][stanfordnlp] department. Check my [blog][blog] for more info as I can tell more.

I earned my B.A. in Anthropology & B.S. in Informatics, specializing in Human-Computer Interaction, both from UC Irvine.

My senior honors thesis was on the culture of people who engage in the [Quantified Self][qsthesis], and my advisor was [Tom Boellstorff][boell].

Check my [blog][blog] for things that are not quite ready for prime-time.

I *try* to reply to all emails that are actually sent to me (and not mass mailers), but if you want to be sure to get my attention I'm pretty sure a book off my [wishlist][wishlist] would do the trick (shameless? Absolutely).
