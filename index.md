I'm a sixth year Ph.D. candidate in [Computer Science][cs] at [Stanford University][stanford] in the [Human-Computer Interaction Group][hci], co-advised by [James Landay][landay] (Computer Science) and [Jeff Hancock][hancock] (Communication).

In my research, I develop and deploy methods for studying **algorithms and algorithmic content**, grounded in theory about bias and representation in high-stakes social settings (like politics and employment) and focused on maginalized people. I use two complementary methodological approaches: first, I use computational techniques like the _algorithm audit_, building systems to understand and improve algorithmic systems; second, I close the loop with methods from behavioral social science to understand people's lived experiences with technology. 

<!-- Before Stanford, I graduated from Brown University with a dual concentration in Computer Science and Science, Technology, and Society, advised by [Jeff Huang][huang]. -->

My first name is pronounced like the verb "deny".
