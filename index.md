I'm a fourth year Ph.D. candidate in [Computer Science][cs] at [Stanford University][stanford] in the [Human-Computer Interaction Group][hci].

My research is co-advised by [James Landay][landay] in Computer Science and [Jeff Hancock][hancock] in Communication at Stanford; my PhD is supported by a Stanford Graduate Fellowship. 

My research focuses on bias and technology: identifying the ways cognitive and psychological biases at the individual level shape our interactions with technology, studying political bias in search results and the web as a whole, and designing solutions to mitigate that bias. 

I am also a graduate fellow at the Stanford McCoy Center for Ethics in Society, and help teach [CS181: Computers, Ethics, and Public Policy][cs181].

<!-- Before Stanford, I graduated from Brown University with a dual concentration in Computer Science and Science, Technology, and Society, advised by [Jeff Huang][huang]. -->

My first name is pronounced like the verb "[deny][danae]".
