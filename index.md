Hi, that's me.

I'm a PhD student in the Computer Science department at Stanford University.
I'm a part of the HCI group.

Previously I was at UC Irvine, where I earned my B.A. in Anthropology & B.S. in Informatics, specializing in Human-Computer Interaction.

I tend to work with

    Web languages like HTML, CSS, JS, & PHP/SQL
    General-purpose (often OOP) languages like Python & Java
    Ethnographic methods
    Statistics (some R)
    And a few hipster-y languages probably not ready for prime time

but I'm always interested in new languages, approaches, and tools.

My last project was [Dynamo](//www.wearedynamo.org), a platform to facilitate collective action.

Before that, I was working on an honors thesis on [Quantified Self](/presentations/QSThesisFinal.pdf) (for which my advisor was [Tom Boellstorff]()).

There might be some stuff in my [blog](/blog) about current projects, but there might not. (the whole point is that I'm working and *not* blogging, right?)

If you want to buy me some books and not get anything in return (except my gratitude), you should check out [my wishlist](//amzn.com/w/26BOYXJ3IHQKJ) \</shameless\>
