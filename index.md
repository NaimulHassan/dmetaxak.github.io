ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to my portfolio!

I am a Ph.D. student and currently a Graduate Teaching Associate in the department of [Computer Science Engineering][CSE-OSU] at [The Ohio State University][OSU] from Fall 2023. I am also a member of the [Audio, Speech and Perceptually-Inspired REsearch (ASPIRE)][ASPIRE] group under the supervision of [Dr. Donald Williamson][williamson-osu].

My primary research interests include **applied machine learning/deep learning**, **audio informatics**, **healthcare**, **signal processing**, **conversational AI** and **ubiquitous computing**. However, I also have research experience on optimised load management of Smart Grids (SG).

Currently I am working on **efficient detection and classification of sound events in medical environment**. I will try to provide updates here.

Projects I've worked on include [efficient sound event detection in the medical environments][asfnet], [speech-privacy-aware cough event detection][ss-ced], [identifying ALS from raw EMG signal][als], [search and rescue with drone-embedded sound source localization][sound-source-localization], [direction of arrival estimation through noise suppression][doa-estimation], [dual-purpose refreshable braille display based on real time object detection and optical character recognition][braille], [peak load minimization in smart grid by optimal coordinated ONâ€“OFF scheduling of air conditioning compressors][peak-load-sg] and [electrical power consumption profile modelling of air conditioner for Smart Grid load management][profile-modelling-sg].

I graduated with both M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees in [Electrical and Electronic Engineering][EEE] at [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)][BUET] in 2023 and 2021 respectively. 

P.S. I love to travel around the world, listen to music, play piano, watch movies/TV shows, watch and play different sports (football, cricket, long tennis and table tennis specifically).
