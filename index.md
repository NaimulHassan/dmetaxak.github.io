## I'm on the academic job market this year!

I'm a sixth year Ph.D. candidate in [Computer Science][cs] at [Stanford University][stanford] in the [Human-Computer Interaction Group][hci], co-advised by [James Landay][landay] (Computer Science) and [Jeff Hancock][hancock] (Communication). In my research, I develop and deploy methods for studying **bias and representation in algorithms and algorithmic content**, focusing on high-stakes social settings like politics and employment, and on the experiences of maginalized people.

Before my PhD, I graduated with dual degrees in Computer Science alongside Science, Technology, and Society at Brown University in 2015. 

P.S. My first name is pronounced like the verb "deny".
