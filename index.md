Hi, that's me.

I'm a PhD student in the Computer Science department at Stanford University.

I'm currently finishing up a [rotation][1] with [Jure Leskovec][6]'s research group in the [InfoLab][7]. There, I'm working on some Quantified Self (QS) stuff and thinking about how it relates to quality of life and other things not as easily quantified as steps. This dovetails pretty nicely with my undergraduate work.

I earned my B.A. in Anthropology & B.S. in Informatics, specializing in Human-Computer Interaction, both from UC Irvine.

My senior honors thesis was on the culture of people who engage in the [Quantified Self][2], and my advisor was [Tom Boellstorff][4].

Check my [blog][3] for things that are not quite ready for prime-time.

I *try* to reply to all emails that are actually sent to me (and not mass mailers), but if you want to be sure to get my attention I'm pretty sure a book off my [wishlist][5] would do the trick.

If this isn't enough, click on some links floating around this text in various places determined by the size of your window.
