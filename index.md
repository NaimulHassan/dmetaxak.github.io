I'm a Ph.D. candidate at [UW CSE][]. I work with the [Sampa
group][] and my advisors, [Luis Ceze][] and [Dan Grossman][], on
*approximate computing:* the idea that computers can be much more efficient
if they are allowed to be imperfect.
I'm interested in languages that help programmers trade off accuracy for
efficiency as well as hardware design, compilers, and software engineering
tools that support approximate programming.

I have worked on the [EnerJ][] approximation-aware programming language,
the [Truffle][] dual-voltage architecture, [neural processing units
(NPUs)][npu], memory systems for [approximate storage][storage],
and a new language construct called [probabilistic assertions][passert].

I am supported by a 2013--2015 [Google Ph.D. Fellowship][google] in Computer
Architecture.
Previously, I held a 2013--2014 [Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship][qinf] with
[Thierry Moreau][theirry] and a 2012--2013 [Facebook Ph.D.
fellowship][fbfellow].
I graduated from [Harvey Mudd College](http://www.hmc.edu/) in 2009.
I have interned at [Qualcomm BARD][bard] and twice at [Microsoft
Research][], where I have worked with [Karin Strauss][], [Todd
Mytkowicz][], and [Kathryn McKinley][].
Here's my [CV][].
