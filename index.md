###About 

I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in [Computer Science][cs] at [Stanford University][stanford] in the [Human-Computer Interaction Group][hci].

My research is co-advised by [James Landay][landay] in Computer Science and [Jeff Hancock][hancock] in Communication at Stanford; my PhD is supported by a Stanford Graduate Fellowship. I also help teach [CS181: Computers, Ethics, and Public Policy][cs181].

My research focuses on bias and technology: identifying the ways cognitive and psychological biases at the individual level shape our interactions with technology, studying political bias in search results and the web as a whole, and designing solutions to mitigate that bias. 

Before Stanford, I graduated from [Brown University][brown] in 2015 with a dual concentration in [Computer Science][browncs] and [Science, Technology, and Society][sts], advised by [Jeff Huang][huang].

In case you're wondering/struggling, [my first name][danae] is pronounced like the verb "deny".
