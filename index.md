ðŸŽ‰ I first became interested in artificial neural networks (ANN) when I first read a blog by Richard Nagyfi titled as [The differences between Artificial and Biological Neural Networks][ANN]. ANNs are inspired by how millions of neurons in the human brain make decisions. Though there are many differences between artificial and biological neural networks, extensive research to train machines to think like a human brain has always fascinated me. Currently I am working on **detection and classification of acoustic sound events (DCASE) in medical environment** with the help of deep neural networks. I will try to provide updates here.

I'm a post-graduate (M.Sc.) student from the department of [Electrical and Electronic Engineering][EEE] at [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)][BUET]. I have also been working as a Research Assistant and selected as a Graduate Fellow (M.Sc.) in the same department, supervised by Prof. Dr. Mohammad Ariful Haque. My primary research interests include **applied deep learning & investigation of neural networks**. Apart from that, I have research experience on optimised load management of Smart Grids (SG).
