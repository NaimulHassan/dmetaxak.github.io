Hi, that's me.

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at Stanford University.

Previously I was at UC Irvine, where I earned my B.A. in Anthropology and B.S. in Informatics.

I tend to work with

- Web languages like HTML, CSS, JS, & PHP/SQL
- General-purpose (often OOP) languages like Python & Java
- Ethnographic methods
- Statistics (some R)
- And a few hipster-y languages probably not ready for prime time

but I'm always interested in new languages, approaches, and tools.

My last project was Dynamo, a platform to facilitate collective action.

Before that, I was working on an honors thesis on Quantified Self (for which my advisor was Tom Boellstorff).

There might be some stuff in my blog about current projects, but there might not. (the whole point is that I'm working and not blogging, right?)

If you want to buy me some books and not get anything in return (except my gratitude), you should check out my wishlist \</shameless\>
