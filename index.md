Hi, that's me.

I'm a PhD student in the Computer Science department at Stanford University.

I'm a part of the HCI group (but I'm rotating each quarter, as per the [first-year rotation program](http://cs.stanford.edu/content/first-year-research-rotation-program)). My last project was [Dynamo](//www.wearedynamo.org), a platform to facilitate collective action.

Previously I was at UC Irvine, where I earned my B.A. in Anthropology & B.S. in Informatics, specializing in Human-Computer Interaction.

My senior honors thesis was on [Quantified Self](/presentations/QSThesisFinal.pdf), and my advisor was [Tom Boellstorff]().

There used to be a section here about my common tools, but they've been shifting around a lot lately; suffice it to say that I use whatever tools are:

- useful for the task
- reasonable to learn
- (bonus) interesting and new

but I'm always interested in new languages, approaches, and tools.

There might be some stuff in my [blog](/blog) about current projects, but there might not. (the whole point is that I'm working and *not* blogging, right?)

I keep a frequently updated public wishlist on Amazon for books I'd really like to read. If you'd like to grab my attention, [buy me a book](//amzn.com/w/26BOYXJ3IHQKJ) instead of coffee.

If this isn't enough, click on some links to the right (or below, I guess it depends on if you're using a mobile device).
