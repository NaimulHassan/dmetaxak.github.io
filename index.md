My name is Dana&euml; Metaxa-Kakavouli, and I'm a Ph.D. student studying [Computer Science][cs] at [Stanford University][stanford] in the [Human-Computer Interaction Group][hci].

I'm broadly interested in the ways technology and humanity mix---how each affects the other, and the insights we can develop about <strong>human cognition, communication, and socialization</strong> by studying that boundary.

As of Fall 2015, I'm rotating with [James Landay][landay], and have an ongoing research project with [Michael Bernstein][msb]. Recently I also interned at [MetaMind][mm].

I graduated from [Brown University][brown] in 2015 with B.A. degrees in both [Computer Science][browncs] and [Science, Technology, and Society][sts]. My advisor at Brown was [Jeff Huang][jeff], fearless leader of [Brown's HCI Group][brownhci].

P.S. In case you're wondering/struggling, my first name is pronounced like the verb "deny".
