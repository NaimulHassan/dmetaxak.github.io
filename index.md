My name is Dana&euml; Metaxa-Kakavouli, and I'm a second-year Ph.D. student studying [Computer Science][cs] at [Stanford University][stanford] in the [Human-Computer Interaction Group][hci].

I'm broadly interested in the ways technology and humanity mix---how each affects the other, and the insights we can develop about <strong>human cognition, communication, and socialization</strong> by studying that boundary.

I am co-advised by [James Landay][landay] in Computer Science and [Jeff Hancock][hancock] in the Commincation department here at Stanford. 

Before Stanford, I graduated from [Brown University][brown] in 2015 with a dual concentration in [Computer Science][browncs] and [Science, Technology, and Society][sts]. My advisor at Brown was [Jeff Huang][huang].

P.S. In case you're wondering/struggling, my first name is pronounced like the verb "deny".
