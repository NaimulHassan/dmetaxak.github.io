ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to my portfolio!

Hopefully, I'll start my Ph.D. in [Computer Science Engineering][CSE-OSU] at [The Ohio State University][OSU] from Fall 2023!

I'm currently a Research Assistant (RA) at the department of [Electrical and Electronic Engineering][EEE] at [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)][BUET], supervised by Prof. [Dr. Mohammad Ariful Haque][arif sir]. My primary research interests include **applied machine learning/deep learning**, **audio informatics**, **healthcare**, **signal processing**, **conversational AI** and **ubiquitous computing**. However, I also have research experience on optimised load management of Smart Grids (SG).

Currently I am working on **detection and classification of acoustic sound events (DCASE) in medical environment** and **intelligent dialogue management in open domain social-bots**. I will try to provide updates here.

Projects I've worked on include [speech-privacy-aware cough event detection][ss-ced], [identifying ALS from raw EMG signal][als], [search and rescue with drone-embedded sound source localization][sound-source-localization], [direction of arrival estimation through noise suppression][doa-estimation], [dual-purpose refreshable braille display based on real time object detection and optical character recognition][braille], [peak load minimization in smart grid by optimal coordinated ONâ€“OFF scheduling of air conditioning compressors][peak-load-sg] and [electrical power consumption profile modelling of air conditioner for Smart Grid load management][profile-modelling-sg].

I graduated with a B.Sc. degree in [Electrical and Electronic Engineering][EEE] at [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)][BUET] in 2021. 

P.S. My nickname is "Prangon". I love to travel around the world, listen to music, play piano, watch movies/TV shows, watch and play different sports (football, cricket, long tennis and table tennis specifically).
