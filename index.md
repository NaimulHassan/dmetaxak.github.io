Hi, that's me.

I'm a PhD student in the Computer Science department at Stanford University.

Lately I've been interested in how online workers (e.g. Turkers) might design 
their own labor markets, which has led me to the idea of an online worker 
cooperative.

I'm currently rotating with Jure Leskovec's research group 
as per the [first-year rotation program][1]. There, I'm working on some 
Quantified Self (QS) stuff and thinking about how it relates to quality of life 
and other things not as easily quantified as steps.

Previously I was at UC Irvine, where I earned my B.A. in Anthropology & B.S. in Informatics, specializing in Human-Computer Interaction.

My senior honors thesis was on [QS][2], and my advisor was [Tom Boellstorff][4].

There might be some stuff in my [blog][3] about current projects, but there might not. (the whole point is that I'm working and *not* blogging, right?)

I keep a frequently updated public wishlist on Amazon for books I'd really like to read. If you'd like to grab my attention, [buy me a book][5] instead of coffee.

If this isn't enough, click on some links to the right (or below, I guess it depends on the size of your screen).
