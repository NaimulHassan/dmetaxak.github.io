ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to my portfolio!

I first became interested in artificial neural networks (ANN) when I first read a blog by Richard Nagyfi titled as [The differences between Artificial and Biological Neural Networks][ANN]. ANNs are inspired by how millions of neurons in the human brain make decisions. Though there are many differences between artificial and biological neural networks, extensive research to train machines to think like a human brain has always fascinated me. Currently I am working on **detection and classification of acoustic sound events (DCASE) in medical environment** and **intelligent dialogue management in open domain social-bots**. I will try to provide updates here.

I'm a post-graduate (M.Sc.) student from the department of [Electrical and Electronic Engineering][EEE] at [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)][BUET]. I have also been working as a Graduate Fellow (M.Sc.) in the same department, supervised by Prof. [Dr. Mohammad Ariful Haque][arif sir]. My primary research interests include **applied machine learning/deep learning**, **healthcare**, **signal processing**, **conversational AI** and **ubiquitous computing**. However, I also have research experience on optimised load management of Smart Grids (SG).

Projects I've worked on include [identifying ALS from raw EMG signal][als], [search and rescue with drone-embedded sound source localization][sound-source-localization], [direction of arrival estimation through noise suppression][doa-estimation], [dual-purpose refreshable braille display based on real time object detection and optical character recognition][braille], [peak load minimization in smart grid by optimal coordinated ONâ€“OFF scheduling of air conditioning compressors][peak-load-sg] and [electrical power consumption profile modelling of air conditioner for Smart Grid load management][profile-modelling-sg].

I graduated with a B.Sc. degree in [Electrical and Electronic Engineering][EEE] at [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)][BUET] in 2021. 

P.S. My nickname is "Prangon". I love to travel around the world, listen to music, play piano, watch movies/TV shows, watch and play different sports (football, cricket, long tennis and table tennis specifically).
