You can [email](mailto:ali.alkhatib@cs.stanford.edu) me if you'd like.
I'm always swamped, so short emails get replies sooner.

I'm also on [twitter](//twitter.com/alialkhatib_) & 
[facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Ali.Alkhatib). I don't care about 
following people [back] on Twitter, but I really dislike adding people 
on Facebook unless we've met offline. I know, it's archaic and stupid 
and you feel personally slighted by this dishonor, but by making this 
a public, announced preference hopefully you'll see that this is in no 
way a personal thing.

I'm sure I'm on LinkedIn, Google+, Quora, and half a dozen other sites. 
Don't try to send messages to any of those places; I'll never see them.
