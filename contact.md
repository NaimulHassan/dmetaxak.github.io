You can [email][email] me if you'd like. 
I'm always swamped, so short emails get replies sooner.

I'm also on [twitter][tw] & [facebook][fb].

I have a strong aversion to adding people on Facebook until I've met them in person.

I'm only saying that to make it less awkward if I don't accept your friend request.

I'm sure I'm on LinkedIn, Google+, Quora, and half a dozen other sites. 
Don't try to send messages to any of those places; I'll never see them.
