You can [email](ali.alkhatib@cs.stanford.edu) me if you'd like.
I'm always swamped, so short emails get replies sooner.

I'm also on [twitter](//twitter.com/alialkhatib_),
[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asalkhatib/), & 
[facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Ali.Alkhatib).

I'm sure I'm on Google+, Quora, and half a dozen other sites. 
don't try to send messages to any of those places; I'll never see them.
